# c++
This repo contains some tests about C++ that I have found useful. The folder
structure is:

- `efective_modern_cpp` contains code that comes from the book: Efective Modern
  C++. Sooo good.
- `desing_patterns_in_modern_c++` constains code from
  [this](https://www.udemy.com/course/patterns-cplusplus/) Udemy course.
- `shaharmike` contains some code posted in this
  [page](https://shaharmike.com/). All credit goes to the author.
